In the operation of addition, when the sum of the addends is greater than 9 in any of the columns, it is called regrouping or addition with carrying over. \n\n3 digit subtraction with regrouping means we need to borrow a number from the preceding digit. In subtraction, regrouping is also known as borrowing. When we subtract 3-digit numbers, sometimes, a digit in the upper row is smaller than the digit in the lower row. In this case, we borrow a number from the preceding column so that the smaller minuend becomes bigger than the subtrahend. This is known as regrouping or borrowing.\n',
